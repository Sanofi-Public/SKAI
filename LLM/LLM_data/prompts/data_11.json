  "Input": "This is a pericyclic reaction with a concerted mechanism, also known as a thermally allowed [4+2] cycloaddition. This is a stereospecific reaction where-in the starting material (diene) reacts with reagent (dienophile) under elevated temperatures to provide the desired product. To describe the reaction rate, we only need a single reaction rate equation. This would be a irreversible reaction where A reacts with B to produce C. This reaction typically goes at high temperatures (above 40). the reaction order is 2 with respect A and 1 with respect to B.",
