  "Input": "I have a substitution reaction that involves starting material and reagent to form product without the presence of base. In the first reaction I have addition of the nucleophile (reagent) to starting material to give product, which is the result of a single substitution. First reaction is first order with respect to starting material but zero order with respect to the reagent. There is a second reaction, in which the product reacts with another equivalent of the nucleophile (reagent) to give a by-product. This by-product is the result of addition of two equivalents of nucleophile (reagent) to the starting material. Reaction orders in the second reaction are 2 and 1 for reagent and product, respectively. The first reaction to give product is faster than the second reaction to provide by-product.",
