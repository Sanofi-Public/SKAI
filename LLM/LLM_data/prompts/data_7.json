  "Input": "I have a substitution reaction that involves starting material and reagent to form product without the presence of base. In the first reaction I have addition of the nucleophile (reagent) to starting material to give product, which is the result of a single substitution. There is a second reaction, in which the product reacts with another equivalent of the nucleophile (reagent) to give a by-product. This by-product is the result of addition of two equivalents of nucleophile (reagent) to the starting material. The first reaction to give product is faster than the second reaction to provide by-product. Assume first oder dependency for all the reactants in rate equations.",
