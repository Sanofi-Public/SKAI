  "Input": "I have a coupling reaction wherein the coupling of two different starting materials is possible using a catalyst to give the desired product. This mechanism can be described by five reactions. The first step of the mechanism involves an irreversible oxidative addition of the catalyst into the aryl bromide (starting material 1) to form the catalyst-reagent complex (intermediate 1). Intermediate 1 further reacts with base through a metathesis mechanism (ion exchange between the catalyst and base) to give intermediate 2. In reaction 3, the second coupling partner (starting material 2) is activated by base to form intermediate 3. In reaction 4, intermediates 2 and 3 react through a transmetallation event to form intermediate 4, where both coupling partners are bound. This complex undergoes an irreversible reductive elimination process, regenerating the catalyst and forming the product.",
