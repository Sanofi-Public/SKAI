  "Input": "I have a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction wherein my starting material can be converted to product through an intermediate. The first step in the mechanism is a intramolecular rearrangement under acidic conditions (Lewis acid or acid \u2013 as the reagent) where the starting material is converted into an intermediate species that undergoes a facile tautomerization to the product through a proton transfer event, this would be the second reaction. This step is irreversible due to the fact the tautomer is aromatic. Assume reactions are happening at elevated temperatures above 25. Assume first order dependency for starting material and reagent but second order for intermediate.",
