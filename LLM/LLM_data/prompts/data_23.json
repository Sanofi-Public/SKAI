  "Input": "I have a transformation that involves the condensation (coupling of two aldehydes) of two starting materials (aldehydes) with a catalyst to provide product. This can be described by 2 reaction.  The first step of the reaction is a reversible addition of catalyst to the starting material 1 to generate an activated intermediate. From there, the activated intermediate can add to the starting material 2 via a reversible addition process to form a second intermediate to provide product. Assume first order dependecy for all the reactants.",
