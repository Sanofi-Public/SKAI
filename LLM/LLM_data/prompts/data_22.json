  "Input": "I have an amidation reaction wherein I am reacting my starting material (acyl chloride) with reagent (amine) in the presence of base to give the coupling product (amide bond). The first step in the mechanism is the reversible addition of the reagent (amine) into the acyl chloride (starting material) to give an intermediate. This intermediate species then reacts with one equivalent of base to lose HCl as a byproduct and provide the desired product through an irreversible process. Assume first oder dependency for all the reactants.",
