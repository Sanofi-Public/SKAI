  "Input": "I have a starting material (aldehyde) that reacts with a reagent (organolithium) to give a secondary alkoxide as the intermediate that can be protonated to give the desired secondary alcohol as the product. The reaction is traditionally ran at low temperature (i.e. -40 to 0) and the rate of reaction is incredibly fast. the first reaction is first oder with respect to SM and reagent. The second reaction is second oder with respect to intermediate. The second reaction is reversible.",
