  "Input": "I have a reaction with starting material and reagent that is coupled together via a [4+2] cycloaddition to give an intermediate species that can decompose thermally via a retro-diels alder to give the desired product plus byproduct. The first step of the mechanism is the addition of the starting material and reagent, that typically react in a cycloaddition reaction via thermal or lewis acid activation to give the intermediate species. This intermediate species is highly strained, and through a irreversible retro-[4+2] reaction that generates product and byproduct, which is typically a gas. This final step is irreversible due to the fact you lose a gas as the byproduct, release ring strain, and generate an aromatic product. These all lead to a reaction that is downhill thermodynamically. Assume first oder dependency with respect for all the reactants.",
