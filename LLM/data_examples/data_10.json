{"Input": "I have a transformation that can be described using 3 reactions. The first step in the mechanism is an irreversible addition of a trisubtituted phosphine as reagent1 to the diazo species (reagent 2) to give a zwitterionic intermediate1. This intermediate1 then reacts with the alcohol (starting material1) to form intermediate 2. The final step in the mechanism is an irreversible reaction of intermediate 2 and starting material 2 to give the final product and phosphine oxide byproduct.", "Output": {"rxn1": {"reactants": {"reagent 1": 1, "reagent 2": 1}, "products": {"intermediate1 ": 1}, "k_f": 100.0, "E_f": 20, "reversible": false, "T_ref": 298.15, "Rxn_orders_f": {"reagent 1": 1, "reagent 2": 1}, "Rxn_orders_b": ""}, "rxn2": {"reactants": {"intermediate1": 1, "SM": 1}, "products": {"intermediate2": 1}, "k_f": 0.2, "E_f": 30, "reversible": false, "T_ref": 298.15, "Rxn_orders_f": {"intermediate1": 1, "SM1": 1}, "Rxn_orders_b": ""}, "rxn3": {"reactants": {"intermediate2": 1, "SM2": 1}, "products": {"product": 1, "byprodcut": 1}, "k_f": 0.2, "E_f": 30, "reversible": false, "T_ref": 298.15, "Rxn_orders_f": {"intermediate2": 1, "SM2": 1}, "Rxn_orders_b": ""}}}
