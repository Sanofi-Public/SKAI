{"Input": "I have a starting material (aldehyde) that reacts with a reagent (organolithium) to give a secondary alkoxide as the intermediate that can be protonated to give the desired secondary alcohol as the product. The reaction is traditionally ran at low temperature (i.e. -40 to 0) and the rate of reaction is incredibly fast.", "Output": {"rxn1": {"reactants": {"SM": 1, "reagent": 1}, "products": {"intermediate ": 1}, "k_f": 100.0, "E_f": 20, "reversible": false, "T_ref": 233.15, "Rxn_orders_f": {"SM": 1, "reagent": 1}, "Rxn_orders_b": ""}, "rxn2": {"reactants": {"intermediate": 1}, "products": {"product": 1}, "k_f": 0.2, "E_f": 30, "reversible": false, "T_ref": 233.15, "Rxn_orders_f": {"intermediate": 1}, "Rxn_orders_b": ""}}}
