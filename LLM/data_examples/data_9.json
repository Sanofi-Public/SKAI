{"Input": "I have a coupling reaction wherein the coupling of two different starting materials is possible using a catalyst to give the desired product. This mechanism can be described by 5 reactions. The first step of the mechanism is an irreversible oxidative addition of the catalyst into the aryl bromide (as starting material 1) to give the catalyst-reagent complex as the intermediate1.  The intermediate 1 further reacts with base through a metathesis mechanism (ion exchange between the catalyst and base) to give intermediate 2.  In reaction 3, the second coupling partner (starting material 2) is activated by base to give the intermediate 3. In reaction 4, intermediate 2 and 3 react through a transmetallation event to now form an intermediate 4, where both coupling partners are bound. This complex goes through an irreversible reductive elimination process, wherein the catalyst is regenerated, and the product is formed in the process.", "Output": {"rxn1": {"reactants": {"SM1": 1, "catalyst": 1}, "products": {"intermediate1 ": 1}, "k_f": 100.0, "E_f": 20, "reversible": false, "T_ref": 298.15, "Rxn_orders_f": {"SM1": 1, "catalyst": 1}, "Rxn_orders_b": ""}, "rxn2": {"reactants": {"intermediate1": 1, "base": 1}, "products": {"intermediate2": 1}, "k_f": 0.2, "E_f": 30, "reversible": false, "T_ref": 298.15, "Rxn_orders_f": {"intermediate1": 1, "base": 1}, "Rxn_orders_b": ""}, "rxn3": {"reactants": {"SM2": 1, "base": 1}, "products": {"intermediate3": 1}, "k_f": 0.2, "E_f": 30, "reversible": false, "T_ref": 298.15, "Rxn_orders_f": {"SM2": 1, "base": 1}, "Rxn_orders_b": ""}, "rxn4": {"reactants": {"intermediate2": 1, "intermediate3": 1}, "products": {"intermediate4": 1}, "k_f": 0.2, "E_f": 30, "reversible": false, "T_ref": 298.15, "Rxn_orders_f": {"intermediate2": 1, "intermediate3": 1}, "Rxn_orders_b": ""}, "rxn5": {"reactants": {"intermediate4": 1}, "products": {"product": 1, "catalyst:1": 1}, "k_f": 0.2, "E_f": 30, "reversible": false, "T_ref": 298.15, "Rxn_orders_f": {"intermediate4": 1}, "Rxn_orders_b": ""}}}
